            Make Way for Noddy is a British-American musical CGI-animated series for children, produced by Chorion of the United Kingdom in conjunction with SD Entertainment in the United States. Based on Enid Blyton's Noddy character, it originally aired in 12-minute segments as part of the Milkshake programme on Britain's Five, from September 2, 2002 to June 16, 2007. It was repeated until early 2016.[1]

In 2005, the American version of the series was launched in the United States on PBS in a half-hour version. This version was a longer format; it combined two of the 12-minute segments with new material. Along with the story episodes featuring Noddy and his friends, the PBS format included two interstitial programs, a music video and footage of British television presenter Naomi Wilkinson from Milkshake! The Say it with Noddy interstitials featured Noddy learning various foreign-language words from a robot named Whizz (voiced by Matt Hill).
